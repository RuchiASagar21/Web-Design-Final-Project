# Mindful-practices

## Description
Mindful-practices is a one-stop, all-inclusive solution for fitness tracking. This web application allows users to keep a record of their daily health indulgences ranging from food, water, exercise, sleep, active activities etc. And observe progress over time. 

This application will be developed with a responsive UI styled using SASS which uses ReactJS that is supported by a scalable NodeJS backend that uses the ExpressJS middleware to route its requests to appropriate business logic functions. User input as well as the information displayed on the applicationâ€™s various pages are recorded using MongoDB. The app also uses several open-source APIs to support additional features such as weather, events, sharing, etc.
